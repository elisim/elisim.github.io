## Eli Simhayev

Hi! My name is Eli Simhayev. I'm passionate about applied research and ML systems in large-scale. Programming & Machine Learning are important aspects of my personal life, as well as professional. They are what I love doing, creating, and learning about.

In my free time, I like to read about consciousness and the brain, and practice Vipassana meditation ðŸ™‚

# About

Hey there! I'm Eli Simhayev.

My interests are Time Series and Deep Learning. These days, I'm working on neuroscience, where I bring these two fields together. Before that, I worked as an ML Research Engineer at BeyondMinds, where my primary focus was Time Series analysis. I completed my M.Sc research at Ben-Gurion University, focusing on uncertainty estimation in deep learning. I'm passionate about applied research and ML systems on a big scale.

In my free time, I like to practice Vipassana meditation ðŸ™‚
